    "Title": "Parallelization strategy for CELL TV", 
    "Abstract": "Consumer electronics devices are moving forward to utilize multi-core processors. We have developed a series of unique applications for TV based on Cell Broadband EngineTM (Cell/B.E.). This paper introduces such applications realized by the capability of the multi-core processor, and shares the strategy we took to exploit its potential.",
