    "Title": "What computer architects need to know about memory throttling", 
    "Abstract": "Memory throttling is one technique for power and energy management that is currently available in commercial systems, yet has has received little attention in the architecture community. This paper provides an overview of memory throttling: how it works, how it affects performance, and how it controls power. We provide measured power and performance data with memory throttling on a commercial blade system, and discuss key issues for power management with memory throttling mechanisms.",
