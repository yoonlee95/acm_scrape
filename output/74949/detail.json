    "Title": "Evaluation of memory system for integrated Prolog processor IPP", 
    "Abstract": "This paper discusses an optimal memory system to realize a high performance integrated Prolog processor, the IPP. First, the memory access characteristics of Prolog are analyzed by a simulator, which simulates the execution of a Prolog program at a micro instruction level. The main findings from this analysis are that: the write access ratio of Prolog is larger than that of procedural languages; and performance improvement requires the memory system to process concentrated, large write accesses effectively.\nThen the Prolog acceleration strategies for conventional cache memories are discussed. Comparison is made of cache memories (store-swap, store-through) and a stack buffer, regarding not only performance but also reliability, complexity and effects on procedural languages. The advanced store-through cache with a multi-stage write buffer and an interleaved main memory are seen to have the same performance level as the store-swap cache. When considering data reliability, the advanced store-through cache is judged more suitable for the IPP than the store-swap cache. In a comparison between stack buffer and advanced store-through cache, the stack buffer is found to achieve higher peak performance, but this is affected by the program features. On the other hand, the advanced store-through cache constantly gets high performance for Prolog and procedural languages. As a result, it is concluded that the advanced store-through cache is best suited to the IPP.\n",
