    "Title": "Parallelizing an index generator for desktop search", 
    "Abstract": "Experience with the parallelization of an index generator for desktop search is presented. Several configurations of the index generator are compared on three different Intel platforms with 4, 8, and 32 cores. The optimal configurations for these platforms are not intuitive and are markedly different for the three platforms. For finding the optimal configuration, detailed measurements and experimentation were necessary. Several recommendations for parallel software design are derived from this study.",
